# <a name="about"></a> About the Project

This project was created to satisfy FreeCodeCamp's Javascript Libraries test project. It required me to use one or more of the front-end libraries taught through this section of the course. While they use Codepen as the final output of the project for testing, I generally start with Create React App on my localhost to complete the coding part, keeping all the code in the index.js. This allows me to test and work with the code in a stable environment before deploying live. When I'm ready, I transfer the code to a Codepen pen for testing and completion of the project. It also allows me to push the project to a Github repo. 

I opted for MaterializeCSS for the added color options and because I did not need a lot of precrafted components. I used a map function for the key buttons, including their letter, sound name, and sound file. I had built a drum kit for the Javascript 30 challenge, but it only included keyPress functions. This definitely expanded my understanding of how to interact with the DOM in multiple ways.
